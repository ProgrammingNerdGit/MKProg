## Installation ->

### to use executable instead of .py go to releases and download your binary, put raw binary in your os's folder in main dir (and i recremend to remove the .WIN or .LINUX in the binary)

1. do ```pip install PyGithub``` (if using .py file raw not executable)
2. next ```pip install pygit2``` (again dont install if using executable) on linux you might have to do ```sudo apt install python-pygit2```
3. edit the "Config.txt" (from your os's folder)and put your github username, github password, and the command for you code editor to open a folder(optinal)
4. (OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED) add executable or .py file to path (get your .py or executable file by looking in the golder with your os)


## Usage ->

### commands ->
##### Run all these commands from the dirrectory you want the project to be in/ where the project is NOT in the projects dirrectory

##### im going to use "$path$" as the path to the executable/.py script but you will put the dirrectory to the script or the path variable (remeber to get file from your os folder)



##### also if your not doing the executable put python infrount of the path/ path variable of your script, but if your using the path
##### variable it might not be nessasary



#### To create a project do (note will not be public untill later, and will auto create an MIT listence file) ->
```$path$ -create "Project Name" "Project Description" ```

#### To open a project do (opening a project will also create a new folder and dowload repo if folder is not already created, or it will update the current project folder) ->
```$path$ -open "Project Name"```

#### To commit your changes do ->
```$path$ -commit "Project Name"```

#### To public project do ->
```$path$ -public "Project Name"```
